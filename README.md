The Digital Renaissance
This project is a visually appealing, static landing page for a conceptual NFT (Non-Fungible Token) marketplace. It has been built using pure HTML and CSS, focusing on modern design principles, layout, and typography.

âœ¨ Preview
The landing page features a clean, soft-toned background with a fixed navigation bar at the top. The main "hero" section is split into two columns. The left side contains a catchy title, descriptive text, a call-to-action button, and three showcase NFT cards. The right side features a creative composition of images, including a stone, a sculpted hand, and a barcode. The page concludes with a unique, scrolling-style footer.
